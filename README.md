# Philosophers

This project is a simulation of the classic dining philosophers problem. In this problem, a number of philosophers are seated at a dining table. Each philosopher thinks and eats, but there are a limited number of forks placed between them.  
A philosopher must acquire both forks on their sides to eat.  

The challenge is to implement a solution that avoids [deadlocks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/) and ensures proper synchronization in access to the forks.
This project provides a multithreaded solution to the dining philosophers problem by levaraging mutex locks.
